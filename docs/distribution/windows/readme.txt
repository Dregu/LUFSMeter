Files
=====

The *.dll files in this folder are VST2 plugins.
The *.vst3 files in this folder are VST3 plugins.

The multichannel-version is capable of dealing with 1 to 24 channels.
Because some hosts don't handle plugins with a flexible number of input
channels very well, a mono/stereo only version of the LUFSMeter is also
included.


Installation
============

Copy the desired file(s) to the VST plugin folder of your host software.
