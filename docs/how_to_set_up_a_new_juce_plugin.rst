0 Fix XCode 4.3.2
=================

0.1 In XCode: Go to XCode -> 'Open Developer Tool' 
-> 'More Developer Tools...' and download the 'Audio Tools
For XCode'. From the dmg, copy the folder 'CoreAudio' to
/Applications/XCode.app/Contents/Developer/Extras
(You have to create the folder 'Extras').

0.2 Fix the files AUCarbonViewBase.cpp and AUMIDIEffectBase.cpp.
The fixed files are included in this project in the folder
FixedCoreAudioFilesForXCode4.3.2 .


1 Audio Unit
============

1.1 Get Juce

1.2 Use the Introjucer to set up a audio plugin (audio unit only)
and call it 'LUFSMeter'. Select all modules except
juce_browser_plugin_client.

1.3 Compile this default project and ensure there are no errors.

1.4 Remove the default PluginEditor.* and PluginProcessor.* files and
replace them with the LUFS Meter files. Exclude the files in the
standalone folder for now.

1.5 Compile the LUFS meter plugin and ensure there are no errors.

2. Standalone
=============

2.1 Click to top icon on the right (LUFSMeter project icon). Click the big +
button on the buttom called 'Add Target'. Select 'Mac OS X' ->
'Cocoa Application'.
Product name: 'LUFSMeterStandalone'.
Company identifier: 'com.klangfreund'.
Class Prefix: (none)
App Store Category: 'None'.
Create Document-Based Application: false.

NOT
2.2 In the LUFSMeterStandalone folder on the left, delete all files
exept LUFSMeterStandalone-Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings.

2.2 In the LUFSMeterStandalone folder on the left, delete
- main.m
- AppDelegate.h
- AppDelegate.m
- MainMenu.xib

2.3 Create a group 'Source' in the LUFSMeterStandalone folder and drag
and drop all the additional files for the standalone application -
located in the standalone folder on the drive - into it.

2.4 Drag and drop all frameworks (exept the ones in the subfolder
'Other Frameworks') from the group Frameworks to the target
LUFSMeterStandalone -> Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries.

2.5 Drag and drop all .cpp files from the group LUFSMeter -> Source 
to the target LUFSMeterStandalone -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources.

2.6 Drag and drop the files that are also used by the plugin from the
group 'Juce Library Code' -> 'Juce AU Wrapper' to the target
LUFSMeterStandalone -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources.
Set the Compiler Flags according to the plugin.

2.7 Drag and drop the files that are also used by the plugin from the
group 'Juce Library Code' to the target
LUFSMeterStandalone -> Build Phases -> Compile Sources.
Set the Compiler Flags according to the plugin.

2.8 In Build Settings, remove the 'Prefix Header' and set 'Precompile
Prefix Header' to 'no'.

from /Applications/XCode.app/Contents/Developer/Extras/CoreAudio
to 'Juce Library Code'/'Juce AU Wrapper'.
