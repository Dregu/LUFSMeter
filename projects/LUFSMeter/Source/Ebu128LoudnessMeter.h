     After the samples are filtered and squared, they need to be
     accumulated.
     For the measurement of the short-term loudness, the previous
     3 seconds of samples need to be accumulated. For the other
     measurements shorter windows are used.
     
     This task could be solved using a ring buffer capable of 
     holding 3 seconds of (multi-channel) audio and accumulate the
     samples every time the GUI wants to display the measurement.
     
     But it's easier on the CPU and needs far less memory if not
     all samples are stored but only the summation of all the
     samples in a 1/(GUI refresh rate) s - e.g. 1/20 s - time window.
     If we then need to determine the sum of all samples of the previous
     3s, we only have to accumulate 60 values.
     The downside of this method is that the displayed measurement
     has an accuracy jitter of max. e.g. 1/20 s. I guess this isn't
     an issue since GUI elements are refreshed asynchron anyway.
     Just to be clear, the accuracy of the measurement isn't harmed.
     But if you ask for a measurement at time t, it will be the
     accurate measurement at time t - dt, where dt \in e.g. [0, 1/20s].
