Installation
------------

It's not allowed to redistribute the VST SDK. Therefore you have to
get it from Steinberg (Search for vst_sdk2_4_rev2.zip at 
http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html) and copy
the ``pluginterfaces`` and ``public.sdk`` folders into the ``vstsdk2.4``
directory.

The second requirement is the Juce framework
(http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/), which is already included.
